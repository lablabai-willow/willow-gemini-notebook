Mindfulness also changes one's relationship to self-critical and self-blaming thoughts, promoting greater patience, kindness, acceptance, and hospitality towards oneself and others. Additionally, mindfulness encourages greater fulfillment in daily life by focusing on the present moment, reducing rumination and negative thoughts, as well as anxiety about the future."
